1)Java main method:
Java main method is the entry point of any java program. Its syntax is always public static void main(String[] args) . 
You can only change the name of String ,array ,argument.

2)Control flow statements:
There are many control flow statement available in java such as Decision making,iteration statement,bracnching statement.
  if,else,if else,nested if,switch
  *Looping(Iteration)
   While,do-while,for,for each

*It does not stop the execution of the loop.

4)Array:

We declare array in java same as other varaible.
*Literals
int arr[]={28,49,58};
*new keyword
it is used to create  instance of a class.

5)ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException:
We will get ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException when the index may be negative or exceed the size of an array.

6)Object create:
syntax for creating object is
  JeyKee obj=new JeyKee();
  when we create instance of class by using new keyword it allocate new heap memory for newly created object.

2.new keyword-->string str1= new String("Hello!");
3.character array-->char ch[]={'m','d','a'};
string str2-new string(ch);

10)(a)Equals:
In this the String is checked in boolean type by checking its memory size.
(b)==.-->
In this the String is checked in boolean type by checking its content by each character.
